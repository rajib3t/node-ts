# Node.js TypeScript PostgreSQL Sequelize Project

This is a basic project setup for a Node.js application using TypeScript, PostgreSQL as the database, Sequelize as the ORM, and migrations and seeds for database management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajib3t/node-ts.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   npm install
   ```

3. create .env from .env-example and set database and mail configurations 

4. Run migrations to create database tables:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate:up
   ```

5. Run seeds to populate the database with initial data:

   ```bash
   npm run seed:all
   ```

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
  - `config/`: Contains configuration files, including database configuration.
  - `controllers/`: Contains controller functions for handling HTTP requests.
  - `models/`: Contains Sequelize model definitions.
  - `migrations/`: Contains database migration files.
  - `seeds/`: Contains database seed files.
  - `routes/`: Contains route definitions.
  - `server.ts`: Entry point of the application.
- `dist/`: Contains the compiled TypeScript code (generated when you run `npm run build`).

## Scripts

- `npm run start`: Starts the development server with automatic reloading using `nodemon`.
- `npm run build`: Compiles TypeScript code to JavaScript.
- `npm run production`: Starts the server using the compiled JavaScript code.
- `npm run migrate:up`: Runs Sequelize migrations to create database tables.
- `npm run seed:all`: Runs Sequelize seeds to populate the database with initial data.
